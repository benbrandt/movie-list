  "overview": "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey invents new modes of scientific storytelling to reveal the grandeur of the universe and re-invent celebrated elements of the original series, including the Cosmic Calendar and the Ship of the Imagination. \n\nUniting scepticism and wonder, and weaving rigorous science with visual, emotional and spiritual elements, it is a transcendent experience â€“ a vision of the cosmos on the grandest scale we know.",
