  "overview": "QI is a British comedy panel game television quiz show created and co-produced by John Lloyd, hosted by Stephen Fry, and featuring permanent panellist Alan Davies. Most of the questions are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, points are also awarded for interesting answers, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question. Points are also deducted from a panellist who gives answers which are wrong, pathetically obvious, or obviously a joke. The show makes use of a loud siren and flashing lights, as a form of humiliation.",
