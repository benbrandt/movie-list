In a mysterious and remote snowy outpost, Matt and Potter share a Christmas meal, swapping creepy tales of their earlier lives in the outside world. Matt is a charismatic American trying to bring the reserved, secretive Potter out of his shell. But are both men who they appear to be? A woman gets thrust into a nightmarish world of 'smart' gadgetry. Plus a look at what would happen if you could 'block' people in real life.",
