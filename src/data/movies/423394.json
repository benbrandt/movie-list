  "overview": "The story of \"Joan of Arc\" is one of the most frequently told tales in cinema's hundred plus year history. This brand new version is a post-mortem/post- modern collaboration between the Great Dane Carl Dreyer and Marie Losier, who inserts herself into the 1928 film as God's greatest lover and France's most cherished martyr. A funny tragedy.",
