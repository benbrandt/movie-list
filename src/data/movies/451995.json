  "overview": "A documentary by Agn√®s Varda and JR.  Agnes Varda and JR have similarities: a passion and questioning of images in general and more precisely on the places and the devices to show them, to share them, to expose them.  Agnes chose the cinema.  JR chose to create galleries of outdoor photographs.  When Agnes and JR met in 2015, they immediately wanted to work together, shoot a movie in France away from the cities, traveling with JR's photographic (and magical) truck. Random meetings or projects prepared, they went to the others, listened to them, photographed and sometimes posted.  The film also tells the story of their friendship that grew up during the filming, between surprises and teasing, laughing at their differences.",
